# unit-4-game
### This is an rpg game based on the matrix.
* First select the character you would like to play as. Each character has different stats.
* Next you select which enemy you would like to fight first. The order in which opponents are fought determine your success or failure.
* Third 'attack'  the enemy until one of you is the victor.
* If you won your fight continue by selecting your next opponent and fight until one of you is the last person standing.
* If you lose a fight you may click the restart button to restart the game allowing you to select a different character or fight enemies in a different order.

This project is meant to demonstrate our proficiency with jQuery to create a functioning game.

### Ben Houston designed and created this rpg for his coding bootcamp.
